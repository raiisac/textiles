abstract = {Sustainable choices and behaviours are becoming ever more important in
our daily lives in all domains of consumption. This report focuses specifically
on the consumption of textile fashion by young consumers in five different
countries by focusing on two consumption phases, the purchase phase and
the discard phase, in addition to examining sustainability issues. The five
countries are Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US.
The purpose of this report is twofold:
a) To describe the current fashion consumption of young consumers and
sustainability related attitudes and knowledge; and
b) To compare attitudes, knowledge and behaviour between consumers
with different levels of awareness and commitment towards sustainability
using a 2014 survey comprising 6,388 consumers, 16-35 years of age, in five
countries.},
